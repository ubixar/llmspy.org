The [system_prompts](https://github.com/ServiceStack/llms/tree/main/llms/extensions/system_prompts) extension 
configures AI requests with a library of **over 200+** awesome curated system prompts that can be selected from the UI.

### Custom System Prompts

You can maintain your own library of system prompts for all anonymous users at:
`~/.llms/user/default/system-prompts.json`

Or for signed in users at:
`~/.llms/user/<github-user>/system-prompts.json`

With the JSON file simply containing an array of names and their system prompts, e.g:

```json
[
    {
        "name": "Helpful Assistant",
        "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant."
    }
]
```
