description: Support for Python function calling (Tools), allowing LLMs to interact with your local environment and custom logic.

## Python Function Tools
Define tools using standard Python functions. The system automatically generates tool definitions from your function's signature, type hints, and docstrings:

```python
def get_current_time(tz_name: Optional[str] = None) -> str:
    """
    Get current time in ISO-8601 format.

    Args:
        tz_name: Optional timezone name (e.g. 'America/New_York'). Defaults to UTC.
    """
    if tz_name:
        try:
            tz = ZoneInfo(tz_name)
        except Exception:
            return f"Error: Invalid timezone '{tz_name}'"
    else:
        tz = timezone.utc

    return datetime.now(tz).isoformat()
```

### Register tools for function calling

You can register simple functions or provide manual definitions for complex cases.

### Implicit Tool Definition

Register your tools within an extension's `install` method using `ctx.register_tool`.

```python
def install(ctx):
    # Automatic definition from function signature
    ctx.register_tool(get_current_time)
```

If no group is specified, tools are registered under the default `custom` group, alternatively you can group them under your preferred name:

```python
ctx.register_tool(get_current_time, group="my_tools")
```

### Explicit Tool Definition

When more fine-grain configuration is needed you can use an explicit tool definition instead, e.g:

```python
ctx.register_tool(
    get_current_time,
    {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
            "name": "get_current_time",
            "description": "Get current time in ISO-8601 format.",
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "tz_name": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "description": "timezone name (e.g. 'America/New_York')",
                        "default": "UTC",
                    }
                },
                "required": [],
            },
        },
    },
)
```

```python
ctx.register_tool(
    edit_file,
    {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
            "name": "edit_file",
            "description": "Replaces first occurrence of old_str with new_str in file.",
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "path": {"type": "string", "description": "Path to the file to edit."},
                    "old_str": {"type": "string", "description": "String to replace."},
                    "new_str": {"type": "string", "description": "String to replace with."},
                },
                "required": ["path", "old_str", "new_str"],
            },
        },
    },
)
```

## UI Management

**Dedicated Tools Page** 

View all registered tools and their definitions at `/tools` page via the left sidebar link:

### Execute Tools

You can execute tools directly from the Tools page by clicking the **Execute** button next to each tool, filling out the required parameters in the dialog, and clicking **Run Tool**.

<Screenshot src="/img/tools/tools-exec.webp" />

#### Results

Upon execution, the tool's output is displayed in a results dialog with specific rendering based on the output type:

<Screenshot src="/img/tools/tools-exec-results.webp" />

### Chat Sessions

When included, the same tools can be also be invoked indirectly by LLMs during chat sessions:

<Screenshot src="/img/tools/tools-chat-gemini-image.webp" />

### HTML Results

Tool outputs containing HTML content are rendered within an `<iframe>` within the results dialog which safely sandboxes the content whilst letting you interact with it and play games like Tetris from the arguments or output of a tool call:

### Top Panel Tools Selector

The tools selector allows curating the available tools for each chat session, benefitting from:

- **Reduced Context Usage**: Each tool definition consumes tokens in the LLM's context window. Disabling unused tools frees up context for longer conversations and more detailed responses
- **Improved Focus**: When fewer tools are available, the model is less likely to be distracted by irrelevant capabilities and stays focused on the task at hand
- **Faster Responses**: Smaller payloads with fewer tool definitions can reduce latency, especially with models that process tool schemas upfront
- **Task-Specific Sessions**: Tailor each chat to its purpose—enable file editing tools for coding tasks, search tools for research, or disable all tools for pure conversation

## Core Tools

See the [built-in core_tools](/docs/features/core-tools) functionality enabling LLMs to interact with their environment, perform calculations, and manage persistent data.

## Available Tools

All available tools and extensions are maintained in the GitHub [llmspy organization](https://github.com/orgs/llmspy/repositories) repositories:

- `duckduckgo` - Add web search tool capabilities using Duck Duck Go

**List available extensions:**

```bash
llms --add
```

**Install the [duckduckgo](https://github.com/llmspy/duckduckgo/blob/main/__init__.py) extension and its `web_search` tool:**

```bash
llms --add duckduckgo
```

This registers the `web_search` tool allowing LLMs to perform web searches using Duck Duck Go.

```python
def web_search(query: str, max_results: int | None = 10, page: int = 1) -> Dict[str, Any]:
```

### Installing external Extensions and Tools

Installing an extension clones it into your `~/.llms/extensions` folder and installs any Python `requirements.txt` dependencies. You can remove an extension by deleting its folder.

**Install 3rd-party extensions:**
```bash
llms --add <user>/<repo>
```

**Manual installation:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<user>/<repo> ~/.llms/extensions/<repo>
```

🤝 Feel free to submit pull requests to add new extensions to the [llmspy organization](https://github.com/orgs/llmspy/repositories) to make your extension easily discoverable to everyone.
