title: Audio Generation
description: Generate audio using various LLM providers
---

Audio generation is an emerging capability with limited provider support where Text-to-Speech generation through both the UI and CLI, currently only supports Google's latest TTS models:

| Model | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview TTS** | Fast, lightweight TTS |
| **Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview TTS** | High-quality TTS |

Typically you'd select the audio generation model from the Model Selector to find models that supports audio generation:

But despite models.dev listing them as capable of audio generation, only Gemini's TTS models are currently supported for audio generation through Gemini's API as Alibaba doesn't yet support the **audio** modality.

### UI & Command-Line Usage

Available in both the UI and on the command-line using `--out audio`:

```bash
llms --out audio "Merry Christmas"
llms -m gemini-2.5-pro-preview-tts --out audio "Merry Christmas"
```

### Output

Audio files are saved locally and accessible via HTTP URL:

```
Saved files:
/Users/llmspy/.llms/cache/c2/c27b5fd43ebbdbca...acf118.wav
http://localhost:8000/~cache/c2/c27b5fd43ebbdbca...acf118.wav
```

### Playback

**From the command line:**
```bash
play /Users/llmspy/.llms/cache/c2/c27b5fd43ebbdbca...acf118.wav
```

<Info>📁 All generated audio files are saved to `~/.llms/cache` using their SHA-256 hash as the filename.</Info>
