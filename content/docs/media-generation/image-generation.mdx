title: Image Generation
description: Generate images using various LLM providers
---

Unlike text generation, there's no standard API for image generation across providers - each requires its own custom implementation. Despite the additional effort required, there's now seamless image generation support through both the UI and CLI with built-in integrations for:

| Provider   | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Google     | ✅ Supported |
| OpenAI     | ✅ Supported |
| OpenRouter | ✅ Supported |
| Chutes     | ✅ Supported |
| Nvidia     | ✅ Supported |

To begin select an image generation model from the Model Selector that supports image generation:

When an image generation model is selected, the chat prompt will the option to specify which aspect ratio to use for the generated images:

### Command-Line Usage

Generate images using the `--out image` modifier:

```bash
llms --out image "cat in a hat"
```

Which uses the `out:image` chat template in `llms.json` for its image generation request. Before returning, any assets are saved to cache and their local path and HTTP URL returned, e.g:

**Output:**

```
Here is a cat in a hat for you!

```

### Specify a Model

Use any model that supports image generation by specifying its **ID** or **name**:

```bash
llms -m "gemini-2.5-flash-image" --out image "cat in a hat"
llms -m "Gemini 2.5 Flash Image" --out image "cat in a hat"
```

<Info>📁 All generated images are saved to `~/.llms/cache` using their SHA-256 hash as the filename.</Info>
